## Introduction
The Syringe Pump project aims to develop a device that can precisely control the flow of fluids by using a syringe. These pumps are typically used in medical, laboratory, and research settings for delivering medications, chemicals, or biological substances at a controlled rate. The goal of this project is to design a syringe pump that ensures accurate dosing, adjustable flow rates, and a user-friendly interface.

This project focuses on the automation of the syringe pump, allowing users to control parameters such as flow rate, volume, and time duration. The system will be designed with safety features to prevent over-pressurization, air bubbles, or other potential failures.


## Key components to design a precise syringe pump
- **Microcontroller**
- **Stepper Motor**
- **Motor Driver**
- **Syringe and Syringe Holder**
- **Sensors**
- **Power Supply**
- **User Interface**
